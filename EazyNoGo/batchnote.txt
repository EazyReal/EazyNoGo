//tag3.3(all amaf, base changed)
//3.4 const double eps = 0.0001;
//3.5 t/2 start update raveq
//from 2->3(formula(andINFQ)/backpro/basenum//eps)
//3.5 differ from haha(INFQ/backpro)
//3.6 no INFQ
//3.7 no one step lookahead, yes INFQ
//3.8 no INQ, onestep

//4.0 best move calculation = mvc
//4.1 one threshold + one step look ahead
//4.2 tp = 0
//4.3 fixed rave[0]path = wp...

//
5.0 simu per step can be controlled, expand strategy(required selected_root > basenum)(removed in 6)
(this make sure corner first)
5.1 apply sim_per_step, select > base => select > base || root

//
6.0
huge bug fixed(initnode params) by printing some node statistics(mvc winrate and raveval)
board reference(&) to be faster
reach 50%winrate vs haha10k
6.1 the ver to test with hahanogo 10000 10games

//todo
7.0
may try some measurement instead of mvc
may try use rave heuristic form instead of score(may not be better, unless consider board)
decide to use
